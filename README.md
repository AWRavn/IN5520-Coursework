# IN5520-Coursework
This repository contains the coursework for IN5520 – Digital Image Analysis.

## Project 1
The aim of this project is to describe textured regions in an image, compute and visualize GLCM’s from each texture, extract GLCM feature images, and segment these images.

See the report for detailed explanation of the scope of this project.

## Project 2
The aim of this project is to implement a multivariate Gaussian classifier and use it to classifiy images with 4 different texture classes. The project combines feature evaluation, classifier implementation, training a classifier, testing different feature combinations and evaluating classifier performance.

See the report for detailed explanation of the scope of this project.
